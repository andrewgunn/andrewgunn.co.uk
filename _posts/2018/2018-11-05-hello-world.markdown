So here we go again. Another ~~failed~~ attempt at restarting my blog. But will it last?

TL;DR _Yus_

So what makes this time different from the last? One thing... my commitment to give something back to the community. 

I've been writing code for over 10 years and rely heavily on Google-Fu to get the job done. Who doesn't these days!? I take no shame calling myself a Full StackOverflow Developer but I'm not sharing any of my knowledge and experience to repay the favour. Even if my words only help one person, it'll be worth the effort. I often encourage colleagues to start blogging but I'm only being hypocritical by not doing so myself. Enough is enough. 

In the past, I've spent more time focussing on the blogging platform than the content. Instead of trying to improve my skills as a writer, I decided to take the opportunity to learn the newest tech on the block by developing yet another blog engine that the world didn't need. Rather than making the same mistake again, I chose [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to power this blog. The experience so far has been amazing. I love that it doesn't require a database because all of the posts are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/andrewgunn/andrewgunn.co.uk) alongside the code. So if someone spots a typo, they can submit a pull request. How cool is that!?

I've already got over 20 posts lined up. I'll be writing about everything [.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/), especially in relation to APIs, client-side libraries such as [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), [Xamarin Forms](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/), [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/), essential developer tools, and most importantly, how to put them all together to make something wonderful. I'll also pay close attention to a firm favourite of mine... [IdentityServer](https://identityserver.io).

Any good blog deserves a design that's _on fleek_ but I'm rubbish at colouring in, which is why I asked [Sammi Walters](https://twitter.com/sammivvwalters), who also works at [Razor](https://www.razor.co.uk), to do her thang. As you can see, she's done me proud and I'm extremely grateful. Thanks, Sammeh.  

Hopefully I've done enough to convince you that I'm I'll stay true it my promise, but only time will tell. 

Thanks for reading and I hope you come back for the next post. And the one after that. And the one after that. 

Andy
